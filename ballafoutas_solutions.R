### EXERCISES ##

# We are interested in adding a condition to Ballafoutas experimental setup.
# We expect that in this new condition we will observe a lower frequency of punishment
# than in "0 - no counterpunishment", but greater than in "1 - counterpunishment".

# Thus, one first step is to check whether the sample size used by Balafoutas et al. (N = 80)
# would allow us to capture smaller differences between conditions with sufficient statistical power.

#### 1. ####
# Use the "log_sim" function we created to estimate the smallest difference we can capture
# with 90% power, given N = 80.

set.seed(123) #Set seed to reproduce same results.

#### 2. ####
# Consider that we want to be able to capture differences of minimum .20,
# with at least 90% power. How much larger should our sample size be?

# CLUE 1: In this case, it will be more than a few, so think big!
# CLUE 2: It would be recommendable to first change Fisher's exact test
# for Chi-squared in the simulation function, since sample sizes will get big!
